## Description:
Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Example:

Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
Note:

Given n will always be valid.


## Solution:
In the example, we can create two pointers ,fast one goes to 3 first ,slow one  start from 1, they have a distance of 2, then update these
2 pointers to the next node at the same time like slow goes to 2 and fast goes to 3 then slow goes to 3 and fast goes to 5. At this time, fast
pointer's next is null, which means  slow pointer is at the pre node of the target removed node 4. So just let ``slow.next=slow.next.next``
to skip the target node. There is a corner case that the algorithm requires that the target removed node should have a pre node. In the example,
when n=5, then it is 1 that needs to be deleted, at first fast pointer needs to go 5 steps which is null,then we set that when initially 
fast goes to a position that is null , return head.next because it is definitely the head node that needs to be deleted(n is valid).

```java
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode slow=head,fast=head;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            fast=fast.next;
            if(fast==null)           //corner case that deletes head
                return head.next;
        }
        while(fast.next!=null){
            slow=slow.next;
            fast=fast.next;
        }
        slow.next=slow.next.next;
        return head;
}
