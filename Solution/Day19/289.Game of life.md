<p>The key point is to store the current state and next state in 2 bits.
We can define that after we search for the neighbors of one element, we know how many lives and we know the 
element's next state. We can store the current state and next state using 2 bits. 2 bits can represent 4 cases.

</p>
<p><strong>00</strong> means both the current state and the next state are all dead.(this is the default case of dead element now)

</p>
<p><strong>01</strong> meams the current state is alive but next state is dead(this is also the default case of alive element now)

</p>
<p><strong>10</strong> means the current state is dead but rhe next state is alive: the case can be transformed from 00 when calculating
the proper numbers of aive neighbors

</p>
<p><strong>11</strong> means the current state and the next state are both alive: the case can be transformed from 01 when calculating
the proper numbers of element's alive neighbors.

</p>
<p>everytime we need to abstract the current state  we just need to use '&amp; 1'

</p>
<p>everytime we need to get the next state we need to use '&gt;&gt;1'
