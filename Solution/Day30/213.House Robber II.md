## Decription:
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
```
Example 1:

Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3
```
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.
             
## Solution: Divide the House Robber II in 2 House Robber I conditions.
We have known the strategy of robbery when the houses are aligned in lines from the House Robber I that every house has two status: 
```
1. include(robbed!): in such status the value of include should be last house's exculde plus this house's treasure.
2. exclude(unrobbed): in such status the value of exclude should be the maximum of last house's include and exclude.
```
Iterate the house's two status. When finished, the result should be the maximum of include and exclude of the house at the end of line.

For the question of circle, the only thing we need to consider is that when the last house is robbed, the first house can not be robbed, when the last house is not robbed, the first house can be robbed.  We just need to adjust the range of chosen houses based on the function of House Robbery I.


```java
public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length==1)
            return nums[0];
        return Math.max(robline(nums,0,nums.length-2),robline(nums,1,nums.length-1));// the last house being robbed or not
}
public int robline(int[] nums,int start,int end){
        if(start==end) return nums[start];
        int exclude=0;
        int include=0;
        for(int index=start;index<=end;index++){
            int e=exclude;                         //store the previous house's exclude status
            exclude=Math.max(exclude,include);     // update the current house's exclude status
            include=e+nums[index];                 //update the current house's include status
        }
        return Math.max(exclude,include);
}
```
