## Description
Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle

[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]

## Solution 1: Recursive method (Time limit exceed)
In the normal thinking order, we start from [2], then to get the min path starting from [2], we need to know the min path starting from [3] and the min path starting from [4]. Then to get the min path starting from [3], we need to get the min path starting from [6] and min path starting from [5]. If we use the recursive method to get the final result of min path starting from [2], the code may be as followed:
```java  
public int minimumTotal(List<List<Integer>> triangle) {
  //最后一个test case 无法通过。可能是递归做法对N个元素要执行2^N次，时间复杂度O(2^n)
        if(triangle==null)
            return 0;
        if(triangle.size()==1)
            return triangle.get(0).get(0);
        return findMin(0,0,triangle);
    }
    public int findMin(int i,int j,List<List<Integer>>triangle){
        if(i==triangle.size()-2)
            return Math.min(triangle.get(i+1).get(j),triangle.get(i+1).get(j+1))+triangle.get(i).get(j);
        int sum1=findMin(i+1,j,triangle)+triangle.get(i).get(j);
        int sum2=findMin(i+1,j+1,triangle)+triangle.get(i).get(j);
        return Math.min(sum1,sum2);
    }
}
 ```
 The last test case in the leetcode can not pass due to time limit exceed. We can calculate the times of recursive method being invoked.
 Imagine there is a n-level triangle:
 ```
 * The element in the last level(n) does not need to invoke.
 * The element in the level n-1 needs to invoke 1 time.(2^0)
 * The element in the level n-2 needs to invoke 2 times. (2^1)
 * The element in thr level n-3 needs to invoke 4 times  (2^2)
 ......
 ```
 The element at the top needs to invoke 2^(n-2) times!!! The time complexity is O(2^n) which is so huge because everytime we want to get  a min path from a specific position , we need to know the deeper level's min path.  In such condition, why don't we calculate from bottom to top?
 
 ## Solution 2: Iterative method from bottom to top.
 We can create a same-size space as the triangle to store each element's min path. For the min path of each element, we can firstly specify that the min path of last level element is just itself, then when calculating the above level, we just need to add the current element to the min value of the two element downside. At last, return the top value. 
 
 But this method would cost n^2 space complexity if the triangle level is n. The improved method can use the triangle space itself, which means the value in the original triangle would be changed, it may be unpermitted in the industry production. 
 
 The best solution is the allocate O(n) space( imagine n is the level of triangle) to initially store the last level's value, then everytime we calculate the above level, just update the value in the specific O(n) space, finally we just need to return the first value of the O(n) space.
 ```java
  public int minimumTotal(List<List<Integer>> triangle) {
        O(n) space , no change to original data, from bottom to top
        if(triangle==null)
            return 0;
        if(triangle.size()==1)
            return triangle.get(0).get(0);
        int length=triangle.size();
        List<Integer> sum=triangle.get(length-1);
        for(int i=length-2;i>=0;i--){
            for(int j=0;j<triangle.get(i).size();j++){
                int sum1=sum.get(j)+triangle.get(i).get(j);
                int sum2=sum.get(j+1)+triangle.get(i).get(j);
                sum.set(j,Math.min(sum1,sum2));
            }
        }
        return sum.get(0);
  }
  ```
