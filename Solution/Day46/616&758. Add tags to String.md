## Description:
Given a word pattern array and a string, if the substring meet certain pattern in the word pattern array, then the two sides of 
the substring should add <tag> and </tag>. Note that a pair of tags can not be contained by other pair of tags to avoid waste.

## Solution:
travel char in the string, find if start from the char, there is substring which meets the word pattern.  if there is ,then update the 
corrsponding position in an initially all zero array to be one to record the status of chars in the string.

When finishing the process above, we process the array which records the status of chars. 

[1,....]  and [..0 1]   : <bold> should be added before the corresponding position '1' represented in the string.

[..1,0]  and  [...,1]   : </bold> should be added before the corresponding position
