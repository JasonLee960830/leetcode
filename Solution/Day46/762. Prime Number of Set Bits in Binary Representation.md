## Description
given L and R, if a number is within [L,R] and its set bits(二进制中1的个数) is prime， then  ans++, return ans.
condition: L and R are fewer than 10^6.

## Solution
 The range of the number of set bits can be decided by the condition. 10^6<2^21. So when number represented in binary number, its number of bit
 sets are fewer than 21, we just need to consider the prime smaller than 21.
 To calculate the number of bit sets of a integer, we can use api 'integer.bitCount(x)' or use bit operators.
 
 ```java
  public int countPrimeSetBits(int L, int R) {
        int ans=0;
        for(int x=L;x<=R;x++){
            if(isPrime(count(x)))
                ans++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
    public int count(int x){
        int num=0;
        while(x!=0){
            num+=x&1;
            x>>=1;
        }
        return num;
    }
    public boolean isPrime(int x){
        return (x==2||x==3||x==5||x==7||x==11||x==13||x==17||x==19);
    }
 ```
