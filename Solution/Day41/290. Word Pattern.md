## Description
Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

Example 1:

Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input:pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false

Example 3:

Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false

Example 4:

Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"
Output: false

Notes:
You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.

## Solution
One travel of pattern and str at the same time. in the traversal, compare if there is a pattern key in the map, if true, then compare whther 
the corresopnding word in the str is the same as the value in the map, if not then return falseï¼Œif true then go on. If the pattern key has never 
appeared in the map key,then compare if the corresponding word has appeared in the map value, if true, then it reveals that different pattern key
points to the same word, so that return false;

## Code 
 public boolean wordPattern(String pattern, String str) {
        String[] words=str.split(" ");
        Map<Character,String> map=new HashMap<>();
        if(words.length!=pattern.length())
            return false;
        for(int i=0;i<words.length;i++){
            char c=pattern.charAt(i);
            if(map.containsKey(c)){
                if(!map.get(c).equals(words[i])) //here map.get(c) is a object that system will allocate a new space. Using == will result wrong answers
                    return false;
            }
            else {
                   if(map.containsValue(words[i]))
                            return false;
                  map.put(c,words[i]);
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    ***Note:  == is different from equals(). If in different objects, using == will always cause false though the string content is the same.***
