## Description
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
   ```
return its minimum depth = 2.
   
Given binary tree [1,2,3],
```
         1
        /
       2
      /
     3 
```
return its minimum depth = 3. not 1!(leaf node should have no child, so root can not be the leaf node )


## Solution: Add the depth by one  everytime invoking the method.If the node is null then return 0;if the node has only one child, then we need to invoke method one time going deeper to this child's path; if the node has two childs, then need to return the minimum of the two childs's path by invoking twice.

```java
 public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if(root==null)
            return 0;
        if(root.left==null||root.right==null)
             return root.left==null?1+minDepth(root.right):1+minDepth(root.left);//process the situation like example 2
        return  1+Math.min(minDepth(root.left),minDepth(root.right));
    }
```
