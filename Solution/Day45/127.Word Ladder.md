## Description
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.
Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
Note:

Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
Example 1:
```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
Example 2:

Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0
```
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.



## Solution(BFS)
[Reference](https://www.jianshu.com/p/753bd585d57e)

Initiate visited set with adding startword. Then search every word in the visited set, add the adjacent words into visited set and remove
from the word set.
***Note: to avoid constant while loop, a temp set is to record the new words added in every step, if the size of temp is zero.retrun 0. else
let visited==temp and go on next step searching***




## Code
```java
public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        Set<String>wordSet=new HashSet<>(wordList);
        Set<String>visited=new HashSet<>();
        visited.add(beginWord);
        int step=1;
        while(!visited.contains(endWord)){
            Set<String> temp=new HashSet<>();
            for(String word:visited){           
                for(int i=0;i<word.length();i++){
                    char[] chars=word.toCharArray();
                    for(int j=(int)'a';j<=(int)'z';j++){
                        chars[i]=(char)j;
                        String newword=new String(chars);
                        if(wordSet.contains(newword)){
                            temp.add(newword);
                            wordSet.remove(newword);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            step++;
            if(temp.size()==0)
                return 0;
            visited=temp;
        }
        return step;
    }
```
