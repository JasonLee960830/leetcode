## Description
Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

Example 1:

Input: [5,7]
Output: 4

## Solution
The  result of all the numbers bitwise Add in the range should be the common bit of every number. For example: 5-7
```
101
110
111
```
The common bit is the first '1', so the result should be 100 which is 4.

In fact , we just need to pay attention to the first and last number of the range. Use the bitwise operator >> << to operate.

### Solution 1 reduce numbers at the same time.
When 101 is not equal to 111, then 101>>1, 111>1  ==> compare if 10==11,  No, then 10>>1, 11>>1  ==> compare if  1==1 true ! Then let 1<<2, because operate >>1 twice , we need to have '1' to its original bit position.
```java
 //Solution 1
        int i=0;
        while(m!=n){
            m>>=1;
            n>>=1;
            i++;
        }
        return m<<i;
```

### Solution 2 Recursive method version of Solution 1
```java
public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
    return n>m?rangeBitwiseAnd(m>>1,n>>1)<<1:n;
}
```
***Note: Remember to  <<1 everytime invoking the function to let the '1'  return to its original position.***


### Solution 3 Update the last number only to get the result.
```java

        while(n>m)
            n&=n-1;  //set the last bit position to 0
        return n;
```
